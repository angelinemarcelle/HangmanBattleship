   There are 6 categories to choose from which are Fruits, Flowers, Animals, Countries, Capital City and Vegetables. 
   Players are to input the number 1 until 6. If you put in an invalid number or any invalid input, 
   the system will ask for another input.
2. After receiving the input for category, the system will then generate a random word of the designated

Battleship ðŸš¢:
In this game of Battleship, you will try to guess the location of ships your enemy had placed on a board. 
You will be given 6 chances to guess the location in every turn. 
If you can guess all the locations of your enemyâ€™s ship before they can, you will win the game.

Instructions:
1. To start the game, the system will ask the player what size of board they want to play in. 
   It can be a number from 4 - 10. The number imputed will be the number of rows and columns in the board. 
   If the player inputs an invalid number or any invalid input, the system will ask for another input. 
2. Next, setting up the board is necessary. 
   The player will hide 3 ships within his/her board, each ship will have a different length (2, 3, 4) and the width of 1. 
   The player will first input the row, column and direction (right/ down) for the ship with the length of 2. 
   Please note that the player can also use indexing, such that -1 is counted from the back, to set up the board.
   The same will be done for the ships of length 3 and 4.
3. After setting up its board, the game will commence. 
   The player will guess the enemyâ€™s shipsâ€™ location by inputting the row and column in the board shown. 
   The board will automatically update the board if the player succeeds in encountering the enemyâ€™s ship 
   by replacing them with an â€˜Oâ€™.  
   If the player can guess all the coordinates of the enemyâ€™s ships one by one before the enemy does, 
   the player will win the game.
4. Happy playing!
